Apply splittext library to have splittext effect on the hero section.
Apply clip-path to the image so that we can have the curtain effect on the image.
Instead of accordion I can try horizontal scroll to the portrait section.
Apply the Three.js fluid effect on the bg image I have in the contact setion.
On the button I use the outline sliding effect on hover.


On the about me page overlay a mask on the image and use gsap animation to either transition the overlay or make the opacity go from 1 to 0.
